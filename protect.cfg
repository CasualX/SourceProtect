// General tips
//------------------------------------------------
// By creating an alias with the same name as an existing ConVar or ConCommand you can prevent anyone from changing / executing that command.
// This config makes extensive use of it to prevent the server from modifying certain ConVars.
// Examples:
//  alias unbindall "echo blocked!" - will prevent you from executing this command (by accident)

// AdBlock: pinion.gg
//------------------------------------------------
// Pinion is a popular advertising network which abuses Flash to play really annoying advertising in motds.
// Follow these steps carefully to disable them from working.
// NOTE! (20 Feb 2013) The guys from pinion have said that they will work on preventing this bypass from working so (part of) it may not work to your satisfaction!
//
// http://nopinion.tumblr.com/
// First we must prevent pinion from connecting to its host to load the ads,
// Add '127.0.0.1 motd.pinion.gg' to your hosts file, use google if you have any issues.
//
// There used to be a trick (creating an empty text file in your tf directory named textwindow_temp.html) to prevent the game from showing a html motd.
// While I've been advocating its use I think it stopped working when Valve switched to webkit for rendering the html. So ignore this advice :)
//
// Pinion also has an annoying feature that forces you to watch their ads for up to 20 seconds (it'll reopen the motd if you click continue too soon).
// Since we're already blocking their ads from loading there's no point for us to look at an empty screen.
// The way pinion works is by asking your client to execute a command 'closed_htmlpage' to notify the server when you click continue.
// No such command exists on your client and thus it'll forward it to the server, however by aliasing it we effectively hijack this command so the server will never know we got passed it!
// BUG: However doing so causes the motd (I don't know if pinion is doing this on purpose) to open by itself at random times during gameplay. To prevent this we have to issue a 'closed_htmlpage' command some time afterwards.
//      Because we have already aliased it the only way for us to send this command to the server directly is with the 'cmd' command, bind it to a key or type it some time during gameplay.
